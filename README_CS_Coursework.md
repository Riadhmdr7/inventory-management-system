 Computer Science COURSEWORK

NAME :Riadh Moudir    CLASS : CS1

  Project 1 - Basic Python Commands
In this project, I practiced the basics of Python like using variables, taking user input, doing calculations, and using if statements and loops. It helped me understand the core structure of a Python program.

 Project 2 - Banking System
I created a simple banking system that asks for login and lets the user check their balance, deposit, or withdraw money. I learned how to use loops, conditions, and input validation to make sure it works correctly.

 Project 3 - Movie Library System
This project lets the user add movies, view the full list, or search by title. I used lists and dictionaries to store the data and practiced using functions and loops to keep the code organized.

 Project 4 - Budget Tracker
I built a program where the user can track their income and expenses. It also includes options to delete or edit entries, and it shows the total balance. I used functions and lists of dictionaries to manage everything.

 Project 5 - Restaurant Ordering System
This is an object-oriented project where I used classes to create a menu and let the user place an order. It calculates the total and prints a receipt. This helped me understand how classes and objects work in Python.
 
 Project 6 - Exploring Movie Data with Pandas
I created a dataset of movies and used pandas to explore and analyze it. I filtered data, calculated averages and profits, and grouped by genre and director. It showed me how useful pandas is for working with real data.
